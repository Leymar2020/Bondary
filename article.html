                <h2>Bondary <span>Peak</span></h2>
                <p>In an effort to conserve the environment and make this municipality an eco-tourism site, 21 villages participated in the creation and development of Bondari Peak’s Unity Garden in Barangay Masaba.
                </p>

            <h5>Bondari Peak lies in a 60-hectare mountainous range between the boundary of Matag-ob and Villaba town.
                The 21 gardens represent the villages in the municipality that were given an area where donated plants, herbs, and trees are planted to contribute to the area’s development.
                Bernardino ‘Bernie’ Tacoy, head of the BGT Cares Foundation, said they envision the Bondari Peak as the center of eco-tourism, wellness, sports, and fitness to bring additional employment to the town.
                “The gardens will be at least 1 km away from each other. We will build a resort here in the future and place different kinds of amenities in each garden,” he shared.

                He added that through the garden, they aim to have unity among all the villages regardless of their status and affiliation.

                ‘Plantitos’ and ‘Plantitas’ are also welcome to sell or donate their plants that will be placed in the gardens.

                Tourists may visit for free during weekends, provided that they will plant trees under their name.

                Aside from its breathtaking views on top of the mountainous range during sunrise and sunsets, Bondari is an ideal place for camping, hiking, bike trailing, and motocross competitions.

                It is also a perfect escape just a few hours from the buzzing life in the cities.</h5>
